<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Torrefied Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Torrefied Pellets market is primarily segmented into two types: Torrefaction and Steam Explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in an oxygen-free environment, enhancing energy density and producing pellets that are hydrophobic and easier to grind. Conversely, the Steam Explosion process utilizes high-pressure steam followed by rapid depressurization to break down biomass structure, making it more reactive and suitable for subsequent processing. Both methods aim to produce high-quality, renewable fuel sources for energy generation while improving feedstock properties.</p></p>
