<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Traffic Control Radar (ATC-Radar) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primary Surveillance Radar</li><li>Secondary Surveillance Radar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air Traffic Control Radar (ATC-Radar) is essential for monitoring aircraft movements in controlled airspace. There are two main market types: Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR). PSR detects aircraft by bouncing radio waves off them, providing information on their position and speed but no identification. SSR, on the other hand, communicates with an aircraft's transponder, offering both position and identification data, enhancing situational awareness and operational efficiency for air traffic controllers.</p></p>
